# 👋 Hi, I’m Snepderg! Welcome to my GitHub!

## About Me
I'm an aspiring computer science engineer with a passion for game add-on development, software engineering, server management, technical support, and project management.

## What I Do
- 💻 I love to write hobby projects that push me to learn more about computer science and associated topics.
- 🎮 My love for gaming drives me to explore how the technology behind them works and to discover how I can use it.
- 🌐 I'm always glad to help when I see someone that needs guidance or feedback on their projects.

## Projects and Focus
- Most of my projects stem from learning to code at an early age via environments in Garry's Mod.
- Many of which are primarily driven by data, and include topics such as sentence analysis, player metrics, and cryptography.

## Collaboration and Contact
- My proudest accomplishment thus far has got to be taking multiple iterations to create a successful emulation of the Enigma M1 and other similar machines from WWII cryptography.
- While I did not build it with GitHub in mind, I do hope to have it uploaded here fairly soon.

💞 I’m open to collaboration in addon development and various other projects.
